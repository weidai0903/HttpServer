1.Features:
All of the non-deprecated methods in the interfaces(HttpServletRequest,HttpServletResponse,ServletConfig,ServletContext,HttpSession) are implemented.
Servlet container is implemented.
Two special URLs. /shutdown and /control. GET /shutdown will destroy all the servlets and terminate the server immediately. GET /control will display a web page, which contains my name, all threads and the status of each thread, and a link to /shutdown .
Based on Milestone one, Servlets can be well loaded and run. GET,POST methods are satified. Sessions and cookies are achieved.
A link to the Error Log can be seen at the top of the control panel.
